## Critical AI Literacy Library ##

### An aspirationally up-to-date collection of pedagogical resources and academic references for college-level humanities teaching ###

My goal is to help make colleagues aware of the rich variety of research and on-going contributions to thinking about the role of humanities education in critical digital literacy around AI/ML.
